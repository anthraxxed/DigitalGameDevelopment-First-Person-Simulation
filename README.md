📌 Module Two Team Project Plan

🕹️ Chosen Scenario
We’re building a First-Person Simulation game set in a futuristic facility. The player’s main objective is to track down and eliminate virus entities scattered throughout the environment.

🎯 Core Game Features
Player Spawn Point: This is the main starting location and respawn hub for the player. It serves as the base point for the mission.

Three Virus Types: Each virus will have its own unique look, movement style, and behavior using basic AI.

🛠️ Additional Features (Selected Tasks)
We chose the following four gameplay features to expand our level design and interaction:

Elevators: Two vertical and two horizontal elevators that help the player access different sections of the map.

Jump Pads: Four jump pads (vertical and horizontal) to boost the player to otherwise unreachable areas.

Teleporters: Four total (two linked pairs) that instantly move the player between distant rooms.

Pickups: A total of 9 scattered throughout the level, including at least 3 unique types like health, ammo, and armor.

🧠 Game Concept
The player is dropped into a containment facility where a virus outbreak has occurred. Their mission is to locate and eliminate all virus threats. To do that, they’ll need to move through the facility using elevators, jump pads, and teleporters, all while picking up resources and dodging or fighting enemy AI. The world will have a clean sci-fi look with functional gameplay over flashy visuals. Navigation and enemy tracking will be key.
